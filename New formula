The provided VBA script uses a regular expression pattern to extract dates from text. However, the current pattern in the script is not specifically designed to handle the format "Jan2023". The pattern used in the script focuses on date formats like "dd-mm-yyyy", "yyyy_mmm", "mmm-yyyy", and others, but it doesn't cover the "Jan2023" format.

To handle the "Jan2023" format, you'll need to modify the regular expression pattern to capture this type of date. Here's an updated pattern that includes the "Jan2023" format:

```vba
Sub ExtractAndCreateDateColumn()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim datePattern As String
    Dim regex As Object
    Dim matches As Object
    Dim cell As Range
    
    ' Set the worksheet to work with
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1") ' Change "Sheet1" to your sheet name
    
    ' Set the regex pattern to match different date formats, including "Jan2023"
    datePattern = "\b(?:\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}-\d{4}|\d{4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}|\d{4}_\w{3}|\w{3}-\d{4}|\d{2}\w{3}\d{2}|\w{3}\d{2}|[a-zA-Z]{3}\d{4})\b"
    
    ' Create a regex object
    Set regex = CreateObject("VBScript.RegExp")
    regex.Global = True
    regex.IgnoreCase = True
    regex.Pattern = datePattern
    
    ' Find the last row with data in column A
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Add a new column to store extracted dates
    ws.Columns("B").Insert
    
    ' Loop through the rows and extract dates
    For Each cell In ws.Range("A2:A" & lastRow)
        If regex.Test(cell.Value) Then
            Set matches = regex.Execute(cell.Value)
            cell.Offset(0, 1).Value = matches(0)
        End If
    Next cell
    
    ' Clean up
    Set regex = Nothing
    Set matches = Nothing
    Set ws = Nothing
End Sub
```

Now the updated pattern should handle the "Jan2023" format in addition to the other date formats mentioned earlier.
